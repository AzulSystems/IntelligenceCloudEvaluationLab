# Azul Systems Partner Lab for Azul Intelligence Cloud

## Intro

Welcome to the Azul Systems Partner Lab for the Azul Intelligence Cloud (AIC). This repo will help you quickly get started with AIC and two of its key features: Azul Vulnerability Detection (AVD) and Code Inventory (CI).

## Goals

- Make sure you can onboard Petclinic into the AIC.
- Make sure you can accomplish these labs using these 3 items:
    1. this README (please follow it end to end and don't skip any steps :))
    2. our Public Docs at https://docs.azul.com/intelligence-cloud/
    3. the instructions for importing an AVD report into a spreadsheet - they will be provided subsequently.
- End up with a running instance in AIC for both AVD and CI. Class-level CI is enabled by default.
- Ensure that you can generate an AVD report in the product UI and that if needed you can convert it to a spreadsheet (your Azul SE will assist you with this)
- Ensure that you can generate a CI report using the Intelligence Cloud Client

## Prerequisites

- Mac or Linux VM (or Windows with WSL) with Internet access
- Installed git, maven, recent Zulu v17+, recent non-Azul Java v17+
- Azul Intelligence Cloud access

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (% git clone [https://gitlab.azulsystems.com/salesengineering/se-avd-lab.git](https://github.com/rstatsinger/PetclinicAVD.git))
2. Log in to AIC and set up a Forwarder on your machine using the directions in our public docs - Forwarder setup is in the Settings portion of the UI. I suggest you download the configuration you've created into forwarder-settings.properties - you will want to edit that file and set forwarder.keystore.password to some value. Start the forwarder and verify that itâ€™s running - you can use the **runForwarder** script from this repo as an example startup script

## Lab 1 - Onboard Petclinic into AIC using Zulu/Core and Create an AVD Report

0. Make sure Zulu is your active JDK
1. Build and run Petclinic using Zulu/Core - **% source build** then **% source run** -  verify that you see the Petclinic UI at http://localhost:8080
2. Shut down Petclinic, then onboard it into AVD: **edit the **runWithAVDZulu-SETME** script to set tags, including AppEnv**, then run the script - verify your Petclinic instance is there in the AVD UI - might take 5 minutes to show up
3. Create an **AVD report** against Petclinic - make sure you are in the **Vulnerability Detection** area in the left nav of the UI - make sure the report name includes your initials
4. Wait a few minutes for the report to create, then download it
5. You can now see a sortable table for the report in the AVD UI: click on the Report ID link in the Vulnerability Detection UI. This is a **goal state** for a pilot or demo for stakeholders who will be using the product directly.
5. To share the value of AVD with other stakeholders: import the report into a spreadsheet - this spreadsheet would be a deliverable for a Pilot for other customer stakeholders - your Azul SE will assist you with this.

## Lab 2 - Onboard Petclinic into AIC using non-Azul JVM and Create an AVD Report

1. Shut down Petclinic
2. Switch from Zulu to your non-Azul JDK so that java --version shows the new JDK
3. Rebuild Petclinic then re-run it  - **% source build** then **% source run** - verify that you see the Petclinic UI at http://localhost:8080
4. Install the IC Agent from the instructions in our public docs - remember to configure the security manager - you might need it during Pilots
5. Shut down Petclinic, then onboard it into AIC using your non-Azul JDK: **edit the **runWithNonAzul-SETME** script to set the Agent Directory (the security manager file will also be expected there) as well as some tags, including AppEnv**. Run the script and verify your second Petclinic instance is there in the AVD UI
6. Run an AVD report as you did for Lab 1

## Lab 3 - Generate a Graphical Code Inventory Report Showing Unused Code

Make sure you have completed Lab 1 before attempting this lab.

1. If you recently did Lab 1 and you set an AppEnv tag, you should have a runnable instance set up for both AVD and Class-level CI. Restart Petclinic with a different tag for the appname than you did before so that you can easily tell that your new instance is onboarded - make sure you've set a value for the AppEnv tag.
2. This lab explores class-level CI, which is the default. Method-level CI will be explored in a subsequent lab.
3. Make sure a tag value for **AppEnv** is included in your tags. **AppEnv** is a special tag that links running instances in AIC with client side processing of application jarfiles - it's the "glue" between the code that AIC has seen run, and all of the code that could run. It will be used by the IC Client to generate an HTML report on the code that has not run. An example for Petclinic might be AppEnv='Petclinic-YourInitials-CurrentDate' If you set AppEnv for the AVD lab, make sure you know its value.
4. Azul will provide to you the Intelligence Cloud Client jarfile. Note: this is a pre-release of the client. Please do not share it outside of your team.
5. An instance needs to run in CI "for a while" so that a customer feels confident that all of the code that might run has actually run. How long is "a while"? It depends:
    - A few minutes to hours, will tell you what's used when the app starts. This also tells you when you come back later you'll have more. You generally wouldn't act on this report. Do this for this lab.
    - A few days to a week, will tell you what's used generally. The app will have gotten a little traffic so an engineer can find what they were maybe suspicious about or get a feel for what would happen if they ran the report for longer. Do this for a pilot.
    - A week or more will provide a more complete picture of things. The longer you wait the more "firsts" you'll see, up to a point. One week of data should be sufficient for a pilot -- the customer would then just do the same thing for longer. Customer environments should watch for longer, generally across month-end or periods of special time/peak usage.
6. Stash the icclient jarfile in a peer directory to your PetClinic project (i.e. create a subdirectory off the main project directory into which you cloned this repository)
7. Log into AIC and copy your API Key from https://azul.crs-prod.azul.com/code-inventory/api. You can either use your existing key or generate a new one.
8. From the directory where you stashed the icclient.jar, run the client like this:

java -jar ./icclient.jar unused-code-diff --appenv=**YourAppEnvTag** --ic=**Your AIC URL**/public --key=**YourAPIKey** --output=./PetClinicCodeInventory

Make sure you substitute in your AppEnv tag, your Public Endpoint, and your API key.

9. The result should be a new subdirectory called **PetClinicCodeInventory**. There should be an index.html file in there - open it in your favorite browser. Read through the contents. You will also find a json file in the subdirectory called **all-code.json** - in the left nav of the index.html file there is a link to **Load JSON**. Use it to import all-code.json into the browser. The result will be a graphical analysis of the used and unused code for Petclinic. Click into the report and examine the details.

## Lab 4 - Method Level Code Inventory

If method-level CI is desired, do the following:

1. edit the file **runWithAICZulu-SETME** and add **notifyFirstCall=true** to the **AZ_CRS_ARGUMENTS** environment variable.
2. Restart PetClinic
3. Wait a few minutes and then re-run the IC Client jarfile as above, adding **--methods** to the end of the command.

## Lab 5 - Creating a Spreadsheet from an AVD Report - TBD

## Lab 6 - API Examples

The **curlExamples** folder contains some sample curl scripts for you to play with to exercise a few of the API calls.
